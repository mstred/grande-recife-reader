Grande-Recife-reader
====================

These are a collection of bash scripts, which can read all the data about bus stops and bus lines in Recife, through the Grande Recife website.

This should be useful to create an alternative to the awesome but then-defunct website [Ã”nibus Recife] (http://web.archive.org/web/20110728111843/http://www.onibusrecife.com.br/).
